# Salesforce News Integration Project

Welcome to this project! This is a simple and straightforward project where we integrate a news API with Salesforce.

**Project Goal:**

This project aims to display news fetched from a news API within a Salesforce Lightning App.

**Components:**

1. **Lightning Web Component (LWC):** This component will be responsible for fetching news data from the API and displaying it in a user-friendly format.
2. **Lightning App:** This app will serve as the container for the LWC component and potentially other elements related to displaying news. 

**3. News Object:**

(Optional) Depending on your chosen news API, you might create a custom Salesforce object to store retrieved news data for further manipulation or analysis within Salesforce.
